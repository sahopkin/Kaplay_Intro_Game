# Kaplay Intro Game

This repository contains the sprites and scripts to build a basic introductory game using Kaplay.Js v3000

The game is built using Google Apps Script and deployed as a WebApp.  In order to do so, 4 files are created:  
- Code.gs
- index.html
- css.html
- js.html

The Kaplay code is all written within the js.html file.  Sprites for the game are stored externally in a PostImages.org folder.
